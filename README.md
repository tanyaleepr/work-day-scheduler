# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

For this repository, the Work-day Schedule was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Moment.js and jQuery). As for the project, it is a day schedule for workers to use in writing their hourly tasks from 9:00am to 7:00pm. 

### Tasks

* This schedule will have the current date and hour for you to access it at anytimen.
* As you write and submit the tasks, you will be able to save the data in your own local storage. That way, whatever you wrote it will stay.
* If you do not want to leave those tasks there, you can always removed them by clicking on "Clear Day!" button. This functionality will allow the data to be erased.
